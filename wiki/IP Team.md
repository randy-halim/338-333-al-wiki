# IP Team Overview

There are a few parts of IP team that you need to be aware of:

- IP Packet prep & room prep

Some of these should be done by ALs on AFI; some of these can be done by any AL.

# IP Packet Preparation & Room Preparation
**Achieved during the week with ALs on AFI**

1. Obtain IP packets & rosters from MTL and check for discrepancies.
2. Ensure rooms Airman are being assigned to are not fully occupied, inhabitable, etc.
3. Set up IP packets with Door Tags, T-Cards, and packet order
4. **Test room keys** to ensure they work!
5. Prep a bundle of linen for each Airman on the empty bed. 
6. Arrange IP packets in roster order (most likely ordered by last name)
